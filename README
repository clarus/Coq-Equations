This package is available on opam in the unstable repository: 

 https://github.com/coq/repo-unstable

Alternatively, to compile equations, simply run 

  [coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile; make] 

in the toplevel directory, with coqc and ocamlc in your path.

Then add the paths to your .coqrc:

Add ML Path "/Users/mat/research/coq/equations/src".
Add Rec LoadPath "/Users/mat/research/coq/equations/theories" as Equations.

Or install it:

   make install

As usual, you will need to run this command with the appropriate privileges
if the version of Coq you are using is installed system-wide, rather than
in your own directory. E.g. on Ubuntu, you would prefix the command with
"sudo" and then enter your user account password when prompted.

A preliminary documentation is available in doc/ and 
some examples in test-suite/ and examples/.
